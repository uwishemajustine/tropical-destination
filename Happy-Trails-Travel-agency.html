  <h1>World's best tropical vacations</h1>
  <ol>
      <br>
    <li><b>Bora bora, french polynesia</b></li>
    <p>First on our list of best tropical places is this peaceful little island known for its picture-perfect honeymooning reputation, and its quaint sun-splashed homes picturesquely perched over the water. If you’re here to relax, try a sunset catamaran sail or daytime catamaran experience, including snorkelling and swimming among eagle rays. For a different kind of adventure, book a four-wheel-drive tour, including lunch and a cruise.</p>

    <li><b>Nassau-Bahamas</b></li>
    <p>Capital city Nassau is a lively affair, abuzz with cruise ship passengers and locals enjoying the local dining and nightlife. Seafood fans should try classic Bahamian dishes such as conch fritters. While you’re here, you can choose to simply park your sun lounger on the white sands, or you can scuba dive among shipwrecks, snorkel through coral reefs, or get to know your surroundings by scooter. You could also try a 90-minute scavenger hunt, ticking off local landmarks as you go./p>

    <br>
    <li><b>Maldives</b></li>
    <p>Strung across the Indian Ocean southwest of India and Sri Lanka, the 26 natural atolls of the Maldives exude an almost surreal beauty due, in large part, to the luminous blue waters that surround them. If slipping into the crystal-clear, soul-warming sea is a top criteria for your perfect tropical vacation, this is the place to do it, as water comprises 99 percent of the Maldives. Paradoxically, it also threatens to inundate the shores of this low-lying island nation.</p>
